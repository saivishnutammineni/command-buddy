# Command Buddy

Tired of Having to remembering the complete commands, navigating the command history to select a command or having to copy a command to terminal?

This extension helps you by showing command auto completions as you start typing a command based on your previous command history.

Create a new Command Buddy Terminal through Command palette (F1).
